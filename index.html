      <h2>Googles</h2>
      <p>
        The Inuit and Yupik people carved Inuit snow goggles from caribou antler, wood, and shell to help prevent snow blindness. The goggles were curved to fit the user's face and had a large groove cut in the back to allow for the nose. A long thin slit was cut through the goggles to allow in a small amount of light, diminishing subsequent ultraviolet rays. The goggles were held to the head by a cord made of caribou sinew.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the early 20th century, goggles were worn by drivers of uncovered cars to prevent irritation of the eyes by dust or wind.[1] Likewise in the first ten years after the invention of the airplane in 1903 goggles became a necessity as wind blow became more severe as aircraft speeds increased and as protection against bugstrikes at high altitudes. The first pilot to wear goggles was probably Charles Manly in his failed attempt to fly Samuel Langley's aerodrome in 1903.

        Goggles are often worn as a fashion statement in certain subcultures, most often as part of the cybergoth subculture.
        They are usually worn over the eyes or up on the forehead to secure 'falls': a type of long, often brightly coloured,
        synthetic hairpiece. Fans of the steampunk genre or subculture also frequently wear steampunk-styled goggles,
        particularly when performing in a live action role-playing game.

        Goggles are also frequently used by anime and manga characters as a fashion statement. For example, it is an
        idiosyncrasy of team leader characters in the Digimon anime to wear goggles. Other notable characters who wear goggles
        are the young Naruto Uzumaki and Konohamaru from Naruto, Matt from Death Note and Usopp from One Piece.

      <h2>The Great Ocean Road</h2>
      <p>
      The Great Ocean Road is an Australian National Heritage listed 243-kilometre (151 mi) stretch of road along the south-eastern coast of Australia between the Victorian cities of Torquay and Allansford. Built by returned soldiers between 1919 and 1932 and dedicated to soldiers killed during World War I, the road is the world's largest war memorial. Winding through varying terrain along the coast and providing access to several prominent landmarks, including the Twelve Apostles limestone stack formations, the road is an important tourist attraction in the region.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Great Ocean Road starts at Torquay and travels 244 kilometres westward to finish at Allansford near Warrnambool,[1] the largest city along the road.[2] The road is two lanes (one in each direction), and is covered by a speed limit changing between 50 kilometres per hour and 100 kilometres per hour.
      </p>
      <p>
        The road is considered a tourist attraction in the area,[3] in which much of the road hugs coastline affectionately known as the Surf Coast,[4] between Torquay and Cape Otway, and the Shipwreck Coast further west of Cape Otway, providing visibility of Bass Strait and the Southern Ocean. The road traverses rainforests, as well as beaches and cliffs composed of limestone and sandstone, which is susceptible to erosion.[5][6] The road travels via Anglesea, Lorne, Apollo Bay, and Port Campbell, the latter being notable for its natural limestone and sandstone rock formations including Loch Ard Gorge, The Grotto, London Arch (formerly London Bridge) and The Twelve Apostles.[7] At the stretch of the Great Ocean Road nearer to Geelong, the road meanders along the coast, with tall, almost-vertical cliffs on the other side of it. Road signs put up along the road warn motorists of possible rockfalls, which have occurred before.

      <h2>Melbourne</h2>
      <p>
The city was founded on 30 August 1835, in the then-British colony of New South Wales, by free settlers from the colony of Van Diemenâ€™s Land (modern-day Tasmania).[13] It was incorporated as a Crown settlement in 1837 and named in honour of the British Prime Minister, William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne.[13] In 1851, four years after Queen Victoria declared it a city, Melbourne became the capital of the new colony of Victoria.[14] In the wake of the 1850s Victorian gold rush, the city entered a lengthy boom period that, by the late 1880s, had transformed it into one of the world's largest and wealthiest metropolises.[15][16] After the federation of Australia in 1901, it served as interim seat of government of the new nation until Canberra became the permanent capital in 1927.[17] Today, it is a leading financial centre in the Asia-Pacific region and ranks 15th in the Global Financial Centres Index.[18]
      </p>

      <p>
The city is home to many of the best-known cultural institutions in the nation, such as the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the National Gallery of Victoria and the World Heritage-listed Royal Exhibition Building. It is also the birthplace of Australian impressionism, Australian rules football, the Australian film and television industries and Australian contemporary dance. More recently, it has been recognised as a UNESCO City of Literature and a global centre for street art, live music and theatre. It is the host city of annual international events such as the Australian Grand Prix, the Australian Open and the Melbourne Cup, and has also hosted the 1956 Summer Olympics and the 2006 Commonwealth Games. Due to it rating highly in entertainment, tourism and sport,[19] as well as education, health care, research and development, the EIU currently ranks it the second most liveable city in the world.[20]
