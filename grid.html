				<h2>Sub-product 1</h2>
				<p>
					The Inuit and Yupik people carved Inuit snow goggles from caribou antler, wood, and shell to
					help prevent snow blindness. The goggles were curved to fit the user's face and had a large
					groove cut in the back to allow for the nose. A long thin slit was cut through the goggles to
					allow in a small amount of light, diminishing subsequent ultraviolet rays. The goggles were held
					to the head by a cord made of caribou sinew.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the early 20th century, goggles were worn by drivers of uncovered cars to prevent irritation
					of the eyes by dust or wind.[1] Likewise in the first ten years after the invention of the
					airplane in 1903 goggles became a necessity as wind blow became more severe as aircraft speeds
					increased and as protection against bugstrikes at high altitudes. The first pilot to wear
					goggles was probably Charles Manly in his failed attempt to fly Samuel Langley's aerodrome in
					1903.

				<h2>Melbourne</h2>
				<p>
					The city was founded on 30 August 1835, in the then-British colony of New South Wales, by free
					settlers from the colony of Van Diemen’s Land (modern-day Tasmania).[13] It was incorporated as
					a Crown settlement in 1837 and named in honour of the British Prime Minister, William Lamb, 2nd
					Viscount Melbourne.[13] In 1851, four years after Queen Victoria declared it a city, Melbourne
					became the capital of the new colony of Victoria.[14] In the wake of the 1850s Victorian gold
					rush, the city entered a lengthy boom period that, by the late 1880s, had transformed it into
					one of the world's largest and wealthiest metropolises.[15][16] After the federation of
					Australia in 1901, it served as interim seat of government of the new nation until Canberra
					became the permanent capital in 1927.[17] Today, it is a leading financial centre in the
					Asia-Pacific region and ranks 15th in the Global Financial Centres Index.[18]
